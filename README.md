# Data structures workshop

One day data structures workshop delivered at Founders and Coders.

**Exercises** folder, contains main exercises for the day. 

**Presentations** folder for presentations delivered during workshop. (Try not to look ahead to what is to come as it will make the experience less enjoyable for you).

**Tests** folder has tests to help check if you have got the right solution, and can be run with ```npm test```. Note that you may have to change the paths in the require statements in the tests to 'exercises', and use test.only for the tests you want to run to make it less noisy (depending on the exercise you are doing). Note that many of the tests (nor the solutions) test edge cases etc. thoroughly. 

**research-topics.md** can be used as inspiration/starting points for research in the afternoon.

**Ignore**: Solutions folder, reserach folder (personal research notes whilst preparing materials), and planning.md (used to prepare the workshop) is temporarily put in .gitignore to minimize noise and distractions, and to avoid the temptation to look at solutions too early). Can put the solutions up after the workshop if requested.
