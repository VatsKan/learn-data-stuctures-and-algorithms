# Data structures

### What is a data structure 

### Why important?
- lots of different ways to implement an algorithm
- some are more efficient (in terms of time it takes and/or spaces it takes) than others
- you don't want to write an algorithm which takes a lot longer (can be days or even years!) than it needs to
- depends a lot on context which data structure is best to use

### Why not important
- you don't really need to know this stuff in the work place, especially for frontend roles.
- some of it may crop up/be helpful in interview situations depending on where/what kind of role you apply for but i don't have any exp. with interviews.

In other words, today is more for interest and don't feel like you have to know this stuff to get a job.

### Definitions
- abstract data type (ADT). 
type of data stored, 
operations supported, 
type of paramaters of the ops. 
specifes what each op does but not how it does it.
- 'element'
