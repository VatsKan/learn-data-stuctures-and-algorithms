# Stacks

---

- sequence of elements, with one end as the top of the stack
(E1, E2, ..., En)

- analogy: stack of plates.

---

- ADT of Stack:
MAIN OPS:
push(e): (insert e at top of stack)
pop(): (remove and return element at top of stack)

ADDITIONAL OPS:
top(): (return top element of stack without removing)
size(): (return num of elements stored)
isEmpty(): (is the stack empty?)

---

- applications of stacks:
  e.g. browser page-visit history, undo sequence in text editor, 
  e.g. auxiliary data structure for alg, component of other data structures.

---

- performance: 
  - Space used by stack O(n)
  - Each op runs in time O(1)
- limitations: 
  - max size of stack must be defined a priori
  - pushing into a full stack causes 'implementation-specific exception'

---

- example usage problems:
  - Reverse elements in array
  - Parentheses matching 
  - html dom tag matching (opening tags match with closing tags). (a bit complex!)
