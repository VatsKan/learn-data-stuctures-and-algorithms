# Space-time complexity

---

| Big O value | Steps taken if input size is 8 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
|O(1)|1|
|O(log n)|3 because log 8 == 3|
|O(n)|8|
|O(n log n)|24|
|O(n^2^)|64|
|O(2^n^)|256|

(not best illustration, as input size n=8 is too small to matter, and n^3 will be larger than 2^n for n=8 here which is not what we want to illustrate!!! )
