## Queues

- analogies: 
  - like a queue to buy cinema tickets.
  - FIFO: opposite of how the digestive system works!

---

- Queue ADT
  - list of ordered elements 'queue', with a front and rear.
  - insertions and deletions follow first-in first-out (FIFO). insertions at rear, removals at front
  - Ops:
    - enqueue(e): inserts element e at rear
    - dequeue(): removes and returns element at front
    - front(): returns element at front (without removal)
    - size(): returns number of elements stored
    - isEmpty(): returns bool indicating if any elements stored.
  - Exceptions:
    - dequeue() or front() on an empty queue throws an EmptyQueueException.

- quiz: queue is front->[2, 11, 3, 7, 9]<-rear. what is front(), enqueue(2), dequeue(), size(), isEmpty()

---

- applications of queues:
  - multiple people using a shared printer
  - round robin scheduler:
  repeat following steps
    ```
      e = Q.dequeue()
      service element e
      Q.enqueue(e)
    ```
  - used in other data structures

- Implementations
  - Array based
  - Queue with a linked list
